# What is the neuromore platform?

The neuromore platform allows you to easily build interactive neuro- & bio-feedback applications and data analysis pipelines using node-based visual programming.

Our software supports a wide variety of biosensors like EEG headsets (e.g. an OpenBCI board, Neurosity's Notion or Interaxon's Muse), heart rate monitors, and other bluetooth devices that you can effortlessly connect to your applications.

# How does the neuromore platform work?

The platform consists of 3 parts: the _neuromore Studio_, _Engine_, and _Cloud_. The _Studio_ is the graphical interface in which you build your applications: from designing the signal processing pipeline (which we call _classifiers_) over defining the application logic in state machines to designing the feedback interface of the experience - all using our node-based interfaces.
The applications you create in _neuromore Studio_ are run by the _neuromore Engine_, the actual backend of your experiences. The _Engine_ loads your classifiers and state machines from the _neuromore Cloud_ and can also be integrated into mobile apps, Unity games, applications running on Raspberry Pis, etc. once you want to ship your application.
Apart from the classifiers and state machines we also store session info in the _neuromore Cloud_. This could be reports from your neurofeedback sessions or data collected in research trials.

# What applications can I create with neuromore?

With _neuromore Studio_ you can build neurofeedback applications for a variety of use cases in the medical, therapeutical and personal development domains.
For example, applications that have already been built using neuromore's platform are being used from burnout prevention and performance increasement over depression treatment, stress relief, focus training for ADHD, stroke therapy and trauma therapy to neuromarketing and breath pacers.
